# ðŸŒ· tulip agent
A reference implementation for an LLM-backed agent using vector retrieval for accessing large tool libraries. \
This approach is helpful whenever the number of tools available exceeds the LLM's context window or would 
otherwise lead to challenges for the LLM to find the correct one.
