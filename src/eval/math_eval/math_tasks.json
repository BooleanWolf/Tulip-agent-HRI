After calculating the area of the park, the architect decides to place a rectangular pond inside the park with a length that is 10 meters less than the base of the park and a width that is 5 meters less than the height of the park. Calculate the area of the pond. Then, find the difference in area between the park and the pond. Finally, the architect wants to know the square root of this difference to estimate the complexity of the landscaping required. What is the result?",
